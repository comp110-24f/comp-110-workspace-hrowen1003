__author__ = "730722910"
# Notes on intended purposes & possible abstractions:
# 1. Feature to quiz user
# 2.store the answers they got wrong for future rounds
# 3. Ideally feature to story input values in an external file
# 4.function to turn a long input seperated by commas into a list of defs/words
# 5. function to grade user
# 6. function to edit existing lists of defs/words after being created
# 7. make it look pretty :)
